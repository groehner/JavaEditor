I use the free Delphi 12 Community edition to compile JavaEditor.

You need these instructions to prepare the compilation:
https://github.com/pyscripter/pyscripter/blob/master/Compilation%20Instructions.txt

Not all components are used in JavaEditor:
1. You don't need "Pyhton for Delphi"
2. Due to colored background painting in the editor an old SynEdit component is used,
which is included in the GitHub source code. See folder Source/SynEdit

The JavaEditor changes the Delphi unit Vcl.Menus.pas.
The var MenuKeyCaps is moved from the implementation to the interface part,
so that they can localized in procedure TFJava.SetMenuKeyCaps;
